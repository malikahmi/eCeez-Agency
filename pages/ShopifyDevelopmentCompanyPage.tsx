    {
      heading: 'Builder vs. Growth Engineer:',
      accent: 'The Real Difference',
      paragraphs: [
        <>Most Shopify development companies are builders: you give them a design, they turn it into a working store, and the engagement ends at launch. That\u2019s a legitimate service, but it treats your store as a project with an end date rather than a growth system that compounds. The store launches, and then it\u2019s on you to figure out why it isn\u2019t ranking or converting.</>,
        <>A growth-engineering company thinks differently. The store is the beginning, not the deliverable. Every decision — theme architecture, page structure, code, content — is made with ranking, converting, and scaling in mind. Speed is engineered because it affects both SEO and conversions. Structure is built for crawlability. Product pages are designed around conversion evidence. The result is a store that doesn\u2019t just exist but actively works to grow the business.</>,
        <>This is the distinction that matters when you\u2019re choosing a Shopify development company. Ask a candidate not just "can you build this?" but "how will this store rank and convert once it\u2019s live?" The answer reveals which kind of company you\u2019re talking to. At eCeez, we\u2019re the second kind — our services span <Link to="/shopify-web-development" className="text-indigo-600 underline underline-offset-2">custom development</Link>, <Link to="/seo" className="text-indigo-600 underline underline-offset-2">technical SEO</Link>, and <Link to="/shopify-cro" className="text-indigo-600 underline underline-offset-2">conversion optimization</Link> precisely because they\u2019re inseparable.</>,
      ],
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Unfair Advantage:',
      accent: 'We Run Our Own Store',
      paragraphs: [
        <>Here\u2019s something most Shopify development companies can\u2019t say: we operate our own Shopify store with over 9,000 products. That isn\u2019t a marketing line — it fundamentally changes how we build. Every recommendation we make has been tested against our own revenue first. We\u2019ve felt the pain of app bloat slowing our own checkout, the impact of a speed fix on our own conversion rate, and the operational reality of managing a large catalog.</>,
        <>Development companies that have only ever built stores <em>for</em> clients are working from theory. When you\u2019ve run a real store, you understand the difference between advice that sounds good and advice that actually moves revenue. You know that the theme decision affects the marketing team\u2019s velocity for years, that a "small" app can quietly cost thousands in lost conversions, and that the unglamorous work — speed, structure, data hygiene — is what actually compounds.</>,
        <>This operator\u2019s perspective is woven into everything we build. It\u2019s why we treat performance as non-negotiable, why we\u2019re disciplined about apps, and why we can advise honestly on trade-offs — because we\u2019ve lived them. It\u2019s the difference between a contractor and a partner who thinks like an owner.</>,

      heading: 'What a Complete Shopify Build',
      accent: 'Actually Includes',
      paragraphs: [
        <>A proper Shopify development engagement spans several layers that a "just build it" company often skips. <strong>Architecture and theme:</strong> a lean Online Store 2.0 foundation, not a bloated multipurpose theme, structured for both shoppers and crawlers. <strong>Performance:</strong> optimized images, disciplined scripts, and Core Web Vitals treated as a build requirement. <strong>Conversion-focused pages:</strong> product and collection pages designed to sell, with sticky mobile add-to-cart, visible reviews, and frictionless checkout.</>,
        <><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> clean URLs, complete structured data, controlled indexation, and a crawlable internal linking structure built in from the start. <strong>Integrations and automation:</strong> connecting your store to the email, analytics, inventory, and — where needed — ERP or CRM systems that run the business. <strong>Scalability:</strong> an architecture ready to grow into <Link to="/shopify-plus-development" className="text-indigo-600 underline underline-offset-2">Shopify Plus</Link>, B2B, and international selling without a costly rebuild.</>,
        <>When you need functionality the theme layer can\u2019t provide, custom <Link to="/shopify-app-development" className="text-indigo-600 underline underline-offset-2">Shopify app development</Link> extends your store with owned code and zero storefront weight. And if you\u2019re moving from another platform, a careful <Link to="/shopify-migration" className="text-indigo-600 underline underline-offset-2">migration</Link> preserves your rankings and data. A complete Shopify development company handles all of this as one connected system.</>,
      ],
    },
    {
      heading: 'How to Vet a',
      accent: 'Shopify Development Company',
      paragraphs: [
        <>Before hiring, put any company through these questions. <strong>"Can I see live stores you\u2019ve built?"</strong> — then run them through PageSpeed Insights yourself; a fast portfolio proves performance discipline. <strong>"How do you approach SEO and Core Web Vitals?"</strong> — vague answers mean it\u2019s an afterthought. <strong>"Do you build natively or with page-builder apps?"</strong> — native code means speed and ownership. <strong>"How do you handle updates and handoff?"</strong> — duplicate-theme process and documentation signal professionalism.</>,
        <>Watch for red flags: portfolios with no live URLs, quotes given without questions about your business, promises that sound too fast to be real, and companies that never push back on your ideas. The best Shopify development companies are consultative — they\u2019ll tell you when a cheaper approach serves you better, because they\u2019re optimizing for your outcome, not their invoice.</>,
        <>Finally, consider fit for your stage. An enterprise-focused company may over-engineer a small store; a cheap freelancer may under-build one that needs to scale. The right Shopify development company matches its approach to where your business actually is and where it\u2019s realistically headed. If that sounds like the partner you want, <Link to="/contact" className="text-indigo-600 underline underline-offset-2">start with a free audit</Link> — we\u2019ll show you exactly what your store needs before you commit to anything.</>,

The best ones go further, engineering performance, technical SEO, and conversion optimization into the build so the store doesn\u2019t just launch but actively ranks, converts, and scales. eCeez is a growth-engineering company: we treat the store as a system for growth, not a one-time project.',

      q: 'How much does it cost to hire a Shopify development company?',
      a: 'It varies widely by scope. A focused theme customization runs from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars; a comprehensive custom build runs several thousand to tens of thousands; enterprise Shopify Plus projects with integrations go higher. The honest guidance: describe your goals rather than a solution, and a good company will scope accurately. We provide a fixed quote after a free audit, not an hourly meter that grows.',

    {
      q: 'What makes eCeez different from other Shopify development companies?',
      a: 'Three things. First, we run our own 9,000-product Shopify store, so every recommendation is tested against real revenue, not theory. Second, we engineer growth — SEO, speed, and CRO are built into every project, not sold as afterthoughts. Third, we\u2019re consultative and honest: we work on duplicate themes, document everything, and tell you when a cheaper approach serves you better.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Should I hire a Shopify development company or a freelancer?',
      a: 'A freelancer suits contained, one-off tasks and lower budgets, but carries single-person risk — they can disappear mid-project or on vacation. A development company brings redundancy, process, documented knowledge that survives staff changes, and the breadth to handle development, SEO, and CRO together. For a store that\u2019s central to your business, a company is usually the safer, more scalable choice.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can a Shopify development company help my store rank on Google?',
      a: 'The right one, yes — because technical SEO and site speed are development concerns as much as marketing ones. A store built with clean architecture, complete structured data, crawlable internal linking, and fast Core Web Vitals is set up to rank; one built without them fights an uphill battle no amount of later marketing fully fixes. We build SEO into the foundation, and offer dedicated ecommerce SEO services to compound it.',

      a: 'Yes. Many of our engagements are improvements to existing stores — speed optimization, SEO fixes, CRO, redesigns, and maintenance.
