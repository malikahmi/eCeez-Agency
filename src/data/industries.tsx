      { q: 'How do I reduce returns on my fashion Shopify store?', a: 'Fit uncertainty drives most apparel returns, so the highest-leverage fix is clear, accessible sizing guidance with real garment measurements and honest fit notes ("runs small," "relaxed fit"), placed where shoppers decide. Better photography and detail shots also set accurate expectations. Good sizing UX lifts conversion and cuts returns simultaneously.' },
      { q: 'Why do fashion brands need custom Shopify design?', a: 'Because a fashion brand competes on taste and identity, and a generic theme flattens both. Custom (or heavily customized) design carries the brand at its price point, expresses a genuine point of view, and builds the editorial presentation that premium fashion is sold on. It\u2019s the difference between a store that looks considered and one that looks like every other template.' },
      { q: 'Can you improve my existing fashion store\u2019s conversion rate?', a: 'Yes \u2014 most of our engagements are improvements to existing stores. For fashion, the usual highest-impact areas are sizing UX, product-page photography and layout, variant selection, mobile speed, and coordinated-set merchandising. We audit your funnel to find where it\u2019s actually leaking before recommending fixes.' },

Beauty is bought on trust and results, so reviews \u2014 especially with photos and skin-type or concern context \u2014 are among the most persuasive elements you can show. Surfacing them prominently on product pages, and authentic before/after user content where appropriate, converts powerfully because shoppers trust real results over marketing claims.' },

      { q: 'Why do comparison tools matter for electronics?', a: 'Because electronics is a comparison-heavy category \u2014 buyers weigh models against each other and against competitors before committing.

Done well, the online store strengthens the showroom instead of competing with it.' },
